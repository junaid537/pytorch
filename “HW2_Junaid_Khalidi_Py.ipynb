I really, Really Love Amazon.com But they really need to Use some of these Catridges for Theirself and Evaluate Them. my Printer was Printing Fine it just needed Ink so I looked these up on Amazon and took a Chance even with more than a few Negative Reviews. I sent some Samples of the Horrible attempt at printing in the Box With The easy return for Refund. Went to WalMart and picked up 2 combo packs of Kodak ink for my Two Printers and Sure Enough it went back to Printing Perfect, Both of the Printers. Well I guess the Fact that Kodak's Ink  is so Cheap that It has a tendantcy to push you to see just how cheap you can get it for. Please Folks Save your Time and Frustrations for more Important Troubles in your life, Don't Be Greedy. Buy the Kodak Ink you Won't be Dissapointed.

This calendar is 2 years old! It does say 2011 in the fine print - but being the sucker buyer I did not realize I'd have to verify if it was current - and I paid almost $20 for this old, useless calendar.  \n",

Recently I had no phones, internet, or security system.  I decided to start with new phones.  After reading all of the reviews I decided this was the phone system I needed.  They came very fast.  Still no phone.  The phone company came out and found a broken cable leading into my house.  Once this was fixed I instantly had phones, internet, & security system.  I wish I had ordered a four phone system as I found another area I would like a phone.  So, checked with Amazon and instantly found one.  It arrived before scheduled delivery date.  I love the \\\\\"talking\\\\\" feature.  I do not bother to answer my phone when it tells me \\\\\"out of area\\\\\".  I am sure my older phones still work!*  Love Panasonic & Amazon!.  \n",

I really, Really Love Amazon.com But they really need to Use some of these Catridges for Theirself and Evaluate Them. my Printer was Printing Fine it just needed Ink so I looked these up on Amazon and took a Chance even with more than a few Negative Reviews. I sent some Samples of the Horrible attempt at printing in the Box With The easy return for Refund. Went to WalMart and picked up 2 combo packs of Kodak ink for my Two Printers and Sure Enough it went back to Printing Perfect, Both of the Printers. Well I guess the Fact that Kodak's Ink  is so Cheap that It has a tendantcy to push you to see just how cheap you can get it for. Please Folks Save your Time and Frustrations for more Important Troubles in your life, Don't Be Greedy. Buy the Kodak Ink you Won't be Dissapointed. Thanks Amazon, for Your easy Returns, because with out them I would really be up the Creek without a Paddle. I just can't say enough, \\\\\"How much I love Amazon.com\\\\\"    Thanks,</td>\n",

I really, Really Love Amazon.com But they really need to Use some of these Catridges for Theirself and Evaluate Them. my Printer was Printing Fine it just needed Ink so I looked these up on Amazon and took a Chance even with more than a few Negative Reviews. I sent some Samples of the Horrible attempt at printing in the Box With The easy return for Refund. Went to WalMart and picked up 2 combo packs of Kodak ink for my Two Printers and Sure Enough it went back to Printing Perfect, Both of the Printers. Well I guess the Fact that Kodak's Ink  is so Cheap that It has a tendantcy to push you to see just how cheap you can get it for. Please Folks Save your Time and Frustrations for more Important Troubles in your life, Don't Be Greedy. Buy the Kodak Ink you Won't be Dissapointed.

This calendar is 2 years old! It does say 2011 in the fine print - but being the sucker buyer I did not realize I'd have to verify if it was current - and I paid almost $20 for this old, useless calendar.   \n",

Recently I had no phones, internet, or security system.  I decided to start with new phones.  After reading all of the reviews I decided this was the phone system I needed.  They came very fast.  Still no phone.  The phone company came out and found a broken cable leading into my house.  Once this was fixed I instantly had phones, internet, & security system.  I wish I had ordered a four phone system as I found another area I would like a phone.  So, checked with Amazon and instantly found one.  It arrived before scheduled delivery date.  I love the \\\\\"talking\\\\\" feature.  I do not bother to answer my phone when it tells me \\\\\"out of area\\\\\".  I am sure my older phones still work!*  Love Panasonic & Amazon!.   \n",

I really, Really Love Amazon.com But they really need to Use some of these Catridges for Theirself and Evaluate Them. my Printer was Printing Fine it just needed Ink so I looked these up on Amazon and took a Chance even with more than a few Negative Reviews. I sent some Samples of the Horrible attempt at printing in the Box With The easy return for Refund. Went to WalMart and picked up 2 combo packs of Kodak ink for my Two Printers and Sure Enough it went back to Printing Perfect, Both of the Printers. Well I guess the Fact that Kodak's Ink  is so Cheap that It has a tendantcy to push you to see just how cheap you can get it for. Please Folks Save your Time and Frustrations for more Important Troubles in your life, Don't Be Greedy. Buy the Kodak Ink you Won't be Dissapointed.

I really, Really Love Amazon.com But they really need to Use some of these Catridges for Theirself and Evaluate Them. my Printer was Printing Fine it just needed Ink so I looked these up on Amazon and took a Chance even with more than a few Negative Reviews. I sent some Samples of the Horrible attempt at printing in the Box With The easy return for Refund. Went to WalMart and picked up 2 combo packs of Kodak ink for my Two Printers and Sure Enough it went back to Printing Perfect, Both of the Printers. Well I guess the Fact that Kodak's Ink  is so Cheap that It has a tendantcy to push you to see just how cheap you can get it for.

This calendar is 2 years old! It does say 2011 in the fine print - but being the sucker buyer I did not realize I'd have to verify if it was current - and I paid almost $20 for this old, useless calendar.   \n",

Recently I had no phones, internet, or security system.  I decided to start with new phones.  After reading all of the reviews I decided this was the phone system I needed.  They came very fast.  Still no phone.  The phone company came out and found a broken cable leading into my house.  Once this was fixed I instantly had phones, internet, & security system.  I wish I had ordered a four phone system as I found another area I would like a phone.  So, checked with Amazon and instantly found one.  It arrived before scheduled delivery date.  I love the \\\\\"talking\\\\\" feature.  I do not bother to answer my phone when it tells me \\\\\"out of area\\\\\".  I am sure my older phones still work!*  Love Panasonic & Amazon!.   \n",

        "Pretrained Word2Vec (Google News 300) performs better for general language tasks\n",

        "It was trained on a large-scale dataset (Google News corpus).\n",
        "It encodes rich semantic relationships between words.\n",
        "It correctly captures King - Man + Woman = Queen.\n",
        "\n",
        "Custom Word2Vec is more domain-specific (Amazon Reviews)\n",
        "\n",
        "It is trained on customer reviews, so it understands sentiment-related words well.\n",
        "But it lacks general world knowledge, making it weaker for analogy tasks.\n",
        "Example: It may not return \"Queen\" for King - Man + Woman, but it might capture sentiment-related similarities better (e.g., \"great\" ∼ \"awesome\")\n",

        "\n",
        "If we need general word understanding, use then pretrained Word2Vec.\n",

        "If we need domain-specific representations (Amazon reviews, legal, medical, etc.),  our own custom trained Word2V on reviews works better"

I really, Really Love Amazon.com But they really need to Use some of these Catridges for Theirself and Evaluate Them. my Printer was Printing Fine it just needed Ink so I looked these up on Amazon and took a Chance even with more than a few Negative Reviews. I sent some Samples of the Horrible attempt at printing in the Box With The easy return for Refund. Went to WalMart and picked up 2 combo packs of Kodak ink for my Two Printers and Sure Enough it went back to Printing Perfect, Both of the Printers. Well I guess the Fact that Kodak's Ink  is so Cheap that It has a tendantcy to push you to see just how cheap you can get it for. Please Folks Save your Time and Frustrations for more Important Troubles in your life, Don't Be Greedy. Buy the Kodak Ink you Won't be Dissapointed. Thanks Amazon, for Your easy Returns, because with out them I would really be up the Creek without a Paddle. I just can't say enough, \\\\\"How much I love Amazon.com\\\\\"    Thanks,   \n",

This calendar is 2 years old! It does say 2011 in the fine print - but being the sucker buyer I did not realize I'd have to verify if it was current - and I paid almost $20 for this old, useless calendar.   \n",

Recently I had no phones, internet, or security system.  I decided to start with new phones.  After reading all of the reviews I decided this was the phone system I needed.  They came very fast.  Still no phone.  The phone company came out and found a broken cable leading into my house.  Once this was fixed I instantly had phones, internet, & security system.  I wish I had ordered a four phone system as I found another area I would like a phone.  So, checked with Amazon and instantly found one.  It arrived before scheduled delivery date.  I love the \\\\\"talking\\\\\" feature.  I do not bother to answer my phone when it tells me \\\\\"out of area\\\\\".  I am sure my older phones still work!*  Love Panasonic & Amazon!.   \n",

I really, Really Love Amazon.com But they really need to Use some of these Catridges for Theirself and Evaluate Them. my Printer was Printing Fine it just needed Ink so I looked these up on Amazon and took a Chance even with more than a few Negative Reviews. I sent some Samples of the Horrible attempt at printing in the Box With The easy return for Refund. Went to WalMart and picked up 2 combo packs of Kodak ink for my Two Printers and Sure Enough it went back to Printing Perfect, Both of the Printers. Well I guess the Fact that Kodak's Ink  is so Cheap that It has a tendantcy to push you to see just how cheap you can get it for. Please Folks Save your Time and Frustrations for more Important Troubles in your life, Don't Be Greedy. Buy the Kodak Ink you Won't be Dissapointed.
