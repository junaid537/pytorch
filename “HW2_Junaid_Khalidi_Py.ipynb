It is not possible to insert the paper bin so as to enable the shredder to run. It will not operate if the bin is not in place, but I could never get the unit to recognize that the paper bin was actually fully inserted. After cleaning everything thoroughly and vacuuming the paper bin area, it worked ONCE! After that I was unable to get it work at all. I returned the unit immediately for a refund.

              "2       I read ALL the reviews Bad & Good and made my Choice, Wrong Choice!!! I really, Really Love Amazon.com But they really need to Use some of these Catridges for Theirself and Evaluate Them. my Printer was Printing Fine it just needed Ink so I looked these up on Amazon and took a Chance even with more than a few Negative Reviews. I sent some Samples of the Horrible attempt at printing in the Box With The easy return for Refund. Went to WalMart and picked up 2 combo packs of Kodak ink for my Two Printers and Sure Enough it went back to Printing Perfect, Both of the Printers. Well I guess the Fact that Kodak's Ink  is so Cheap that It has a tendantcy to push you to see just how cheap you can get it for. Please Folks Save your Time and Frustrations for more Important Troubles in your life, Don't Be Greedy. Buy the Kodak Ink you Won't be Dissapointed. Thanks Amazon, for Your easy Returns, because with out them I would really be up the Creek without a Paddle. I just can't say enough, \\\\\"How much I love Amazon.com\\\\\"    Thanks,  \n",

Recently I had no phones, internet, or security system.  I decided to start with new phones.  After reading all of the reviews I decided this was the phone system I needed.  They came very fast.  Still no phone.  The phone company came out and found a broken cable leading into my house.  Once this was fixed I instantly had phones, internet, & security system.  I wish I had ordered a four phone system as I found another area I would like a phone.  So, checked with Amazon and instantly found one.  It arrived before scheduled delivery date.  I love the \\\\\"talking\\\\\" feature.  I do not bother to answer my phone when it tells me \\\\\"out of area\\\\\".  I am sure my older phones still work!*  Love Panasonic & Amazon!.  \n",

I sent some Samples of the Horrible attempt at printing in the Box With The easy return for Refund. Went to WalMart and picked up 2 combo packs of Kodak ink for my Two Printers and Sure Enough it went back to Printing Perfect, Both of the Printers. Well I guess the Fact that Kodak's Ink  is so Cheap that It has a tendantcy to push you to see just how cheap you can get it for. Please Folks Save your Time and Frustrations for more Important Troubles in your life, Don't Be Greedy. Buy the Kodak Ink you Won't be Dissapointed.

              "2       I read ALL the reviews Bad & Good and made my Choice, Wrong Choice!!! I really, Really Love Amazon.com But they really need to Use some of these Catridges for Theirself and Evaluate Them. my Printer was Printing Fine it just needed Ink so I looked these up on Amazon and took a Chance even with more than a few Negative Reviews. I sent some Samples of the Horrible attempt at printing in the Box With The easy return for Refund. Went to WalMart and picked up 2 combo packs of Kodak ink for my Two Printers and Sure Enough it went back to Printing Perfect, Both of the Printers. Well I guess the Fact that Kodak's Ink  is so Cheap that It has a tendantcy to push you to see just how cheap you can get it for. Please Folks Save your Time and Frustrations for more Important Troubles in your life, Don't Be Greedy. Buy the Kodak Ink you Won't be Dissapointed. Thanks Amazon, for Your easy Returns, because with out them I would really be up the Creek without a Paddle. I just can't say enough, \\\\\"How much I love Amazon.com\\\\\"    Thanks,   \n",

Recently I had no phones, internet, or security system.  I decided to start with new phones.  After reading all of the reviews I decided this was the phone system I needed.  They came very fast.  Still no phone.  The phone company came out and found a broken cable leading into my house.  Once this was fixed I instantly had phones, internet, & security system.  I wish I had ordered a four phone system as I found another area I would like a phone.  So, checked with Amazon and instantly found one.  It arrived before scheduled delivery date.  I love the \\\\\"talking\\\\\" feature.  I do not bother to answer my phone when it tells me \\\\\"out of area\\\\\".  I am sure my older phones still work!*  Love Panasonic & Amazon!.   \n",

I sent some Samples of the Horrible attempt at printing in the Box With The easy return for Refund. Went to WalMart and picked up 2 combo packs of Kodak ink for my Two Printers and Sure Enough it went back to Printing Perfect, Both of the Printers. Well I guess the Fact that Kodak's Ink  is so Cheap that It has a tendantcy to push you to see just how cheap you can get it for. Please Folks Save your Time and Frustrations for more Important Troubles in your life, Don't Be Greedy. Buy the Kodak Ink you Won't be Dissapointed.
